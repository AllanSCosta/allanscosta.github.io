I'm Allan Costa, a PhD student at the [Center for Bits and Atoms](https://cba.mit.edu), [Molecular Machines](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/molecular-machines/overview/) under Prof. Joseph Jacobson, and at the [Atomic Architects](https://atomicarchitects.github.io) group at the [MIT RLE](https://www.rle.mit.edu), co-advised by Prof. Tess Smidt.

I do research on biomolecular modeling through machine learning, with particular focus on generative architectures and their applications to biological design.


Always up for a good chat with a good espresso.
